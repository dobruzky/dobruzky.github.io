The User has the right to refuse to accept changes and additions to this Policy, which means that the User refuses to use the Service. The refusal to use the Service is carried out as follows: <br>
                  The Tip Payer does not accept the Policy in the current version and does not use the Service's capabilities to transfer funds (tips) in non-cash form from the Tip Payer to the Tip Recipient. <br>
                  The Tip Recipient and the Administrator send the Operator a notification to the email address: <a href="mailto:support@tipse.ge">support@tipse.ge</a> <br>
                  The Operator processes the notification within 7 (seven) business days and disconnects the Tip User from the Service. <br>
                  5.4. The current version of the Policy is located at: <a href="https://tipse.ge">https://tipse.ge</a> .
